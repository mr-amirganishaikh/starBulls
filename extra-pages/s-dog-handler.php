                        <h2>Dog Handler</h2>
                        <p>We provide Dog Squad handlers who are security licensed and certified as Security Dog Handlers under the national accreditation standards in India. Our dogs are qualified under strict training and assessment criteria along with their handlers. This helps the dogs build a close rapport with their handlers.</p>
                        <p>As part of the training, each Security Dog Squad Unit undertakes a weekly training regime for the development of higher levels of security dog handling ability as well as ongoing assessment and maintenance. This has been proved to be very useful and satisfactory to our clients. We have exclusively trained dogs for personal protection and securing sensitive locations. We provide service to our client in the highly sensitive areas, without compromising on their security level throughout their infrastructure.
